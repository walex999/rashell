This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

There are many benefits to working on this project:
- Learning Rust, its syntax and getting back in shape with programming
- Having a better understanding of how shells work and how certain features are implemented
- Using a new working environment (Rust, with Neovim as my only IDE)
- Playing with Git, having different remotes at the same time etc.
